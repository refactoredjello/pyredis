**PyRedis**

PyRedis is a from-scratch implementation of a Redis server in python. The motivation is purely educational.
The goal is to get a better understanding of networking programming via a full implementation of the RESP protocol, 
and a lower level understanding of in-memory data structures and stores.

This project is not intended for production use!
